# E-commerce store
  In this project, I have created a functional e-commerce website where users can browse products, add them to their cart, 
  add to their favorite list, searching, and filter.
  
  Please, check the demo page of app --- [DEMO](https://valntyn.github.io/my-phone-e-commerce/)

  
# Technologies used
- React.js
- TypeScript
- React Router(v6)
- Redux, Redux tool-kit
- Fetch, API
- Sass (SCSS)
- BEM methodology

# Structure
The application was developed using React hooks.
Each component in the application is independent 
and can be reused in different parts of the project.
Reusable components styled by BEM that can be easily integrated into different parts of the application,
without the risk of introducing unintended styling conflicts or affecting the layout of other components.

# Functionality

The application is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
This is achieved through the use of responsive design techniques, such as media queries and flexible grid systems.

The main page consists of several components:

- Responsive images carousel that is designed to adjust and adapt to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on all devices.
Images can change both manually and automatically after a certain time.
- 小arousel of products with the highest percentage of discounts, where changing the resolution changes the scroll step.
- 小atalos of products that lead to links with a page with products according to products type.
- 小arousel of products filtered from new to old, where changing the resolution changes the scroll step.
